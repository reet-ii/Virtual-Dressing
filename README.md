# Virtual-Dressing
## SEGMENTATION TASK
Done fashion segmentation preprocessing and model development using fastai library.
**Got an accuracy of around 95%**

Enabling remote virtual dressing for major fashion brands. Developed optimised fine-grained segmentation U-Net models using datasets consisting of diverse fashion apparel with an accuracy of around 95 percent. This dataset contains images of people wearing a variety of clothing types in a variety of poses. 

Original images are resized after training for some time to make use of the trained model like a pre-trained network, and then training further to improve results.
The two sizes used are 224x224 and 560x560, initially being 224 changed to 560. The sizes chosen as such due to gpu and memory restrictions and training time.
